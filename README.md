TourPro - Tourism management system

Developed a web application to manage information for a Sri Lankan inbound tourism company called Tourpro.
There are 12 employees working in this company, and we hope to ease off their work (time-consuming cost calculations) and save a lot of time by using this application. 
The most important thing is that the company doesn't need to meet their customers directly; 
they can interact with employees through this application. It is a safe and effective way to contact each other in this COVID-19 situation.
The web system includes 8 main functions, and all these functions have sub-functions, including CRUD and search functions. 
We are planning to write this app using programming languages like Java, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Also, we will use frameworks like Bootstrap to design, 
and we will do our best to develop an efficient web-based application in less time.

Skills: Java · JavaScript · PHP · SQL
